Simple Calculator using Python

The difference between this calculator and the basic calculator we build in our high schools  is it does not stop after calculating the first result.
Like a normal calculaltor we use on our phones, you can use the result obtained in the previous math can be used again in next calculation.
Even you can evaluate the expressions like 5*9*8+2 in a single go.
